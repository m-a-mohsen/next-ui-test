## Overview

- Backend development refers to server-side development.
- It focuses on databases, scripting, website architecture, and the algorithms to make the web application work.

## Languages

- Common backend languages include JavaScript (Node.js), Python, Java, Ruby, PHP, and .NET.

## Databases

- Backend developers interact with databases to store, retrieve, and manipulate data.
- Common databases include MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and SQL Server.

## Server

- The server handles client requests and responds accordingly.
- Common server technologies include Express.js (Node.js), Django (Python), and Rails (Ruby).

## APIs

- APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) allow different software applications to communicate with each other.
- REST and GraphQL are common API architectures.

## Authentication & Authorization

- Authentication verifies who the user is, while authorization determines what they can do.
- OAuth, JWT, and sessions are common methods for managing user authentication and authorization.

## Testing

- Testing ensures that the code is working as expected.
- Unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests are common types of testing in backend development.
